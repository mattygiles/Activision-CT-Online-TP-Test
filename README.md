# Activision-CT-Online-TP-Test

Hello,

I just sent you an invite to complete our HackerRank test – the subject line should read “Activision CT-Online / TP Test Invitation”. You may need to check your spam folder if you do not find the message in your main inbox.

Please be sure to take the 3-hour test before ##/##/####.

A few notes when taking the test: 

You can use any language you wish when taking the test; however, do not use C++ for the second question.

Additionally, for the second question we recommend you choosing a language that has a built-in HTTP API.

Additionally, I want to make sure you are aware that this position is located on-site in Sherman Oaks, California. 

Please reach out with any questions in the meantime.
